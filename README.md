Project Goals:
  1. Become fimilar with using a github repo.
  2. Learn how to use .svg and .csv files in programs.
  3. Provide a potential employer an example of my code.
  4. Learn to properly orginize code and file.
  5. Become better at python.
  6. Create something I can be proud of.
  7. Find what county is the furthest away from a national park.
  
Current TODOs:
  1. Remove the missing 9 counties from the list and provide them adjacent counties  
  2. Find proper shortest path algorithm that fits my needs
  3. Test with a small set first ex: Washington, Alaska, Colorado
  4. Fix any issues with small tests
  5. Move to entire USA map
  6. Fix any issues
  7. Comment it.
  

Future Development:
  1. Update County data with 2010 or 2014+ Census Data. Currently at 2000 Census Data I belive 
  2. Comment and Orginize the files to provide better readablity.
  3. Allow easier intergration into other possible adjacent county based projects.
